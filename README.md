This project was developed by me with the courses I took.


# Personal Portfolio Project
This is a personal portfolio project showcasing your skills, projects, and experiences. It is built using HTML, CSS,JAVASCRIPT , the Nunjucks (Njk) template engine, and Node.js with Express.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- **public**: This folder contains all the images and CSS files used in the project.
- **views**: Inside this folder, you will find the `index.njk` file, which is the main template for your portfolio.
- **server.js**: This file is used to write server-side scripts and serves as the entry point for your Node.js application. We also use nodemon for development to automatically reload the server when changes are made.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Pratiks88/portfolio.git
   cd your-portfolio-project


2. Install project dependencies:

   npm init
   npm install express 
   npm install nodemon 
   npm install njk

3. Start the development server using nodemon:

   
   nodemon server.js


   Your portfolio should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Project Customization

- Modify the content of the `index.njk` file in the `views` folder to personalize your portfolio with your own information, projects, and experiences.

## Deployment

To deploy your portfolio project, you can choose from various hosting services like Heroku, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or others. Make sure to adjust the deployment settings to suit your chosen platform.
